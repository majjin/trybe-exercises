  This webpage contains an image of a planet, an image of a creature, and a div with a greeting. Your job is to make it look like the creature is sitting on the planet and saying the greeting. In this first step, use absolute positioning to put the creature on top of the planet somewhere.
  In this second step, position the greeting on top of the planet as well.
  Now use a z-index property to make sure that the greeting always shows up over the creature, not behind. -->
